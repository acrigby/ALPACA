### Accelerated Learning Program for Advanced Control Algorithms 

A library to perform reinforcement learning to generate complex control strategies for integrated energy system transient models written in Modelica.

## Building Local version of Gymnasium
To run the new gymasium enviroments clone the fork of gymnasium found as a submodule to this repository then run the command:
<br>`pip install ~/ALPACA/gymnasium`
in the folder of ALPACA.

## File Dependencies
There exists a txt file in the ALPACA/Utilities folder called ModelicaPaths.txt. This should be updated with links to all dependent modelica packages
